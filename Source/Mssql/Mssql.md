# Mssql #

OpenKiln can be operated without storing historical data. However, it is very handy to recall data on how the trends looked during the run. I use Mssql as my database of choice but you can easily make changes in Node-Red to use another type of database.

You can find all the scripts needed to create the tables and stored procedures for OpenKiln [here](/Source/Mssql/Scripts). Run these scripts in your Mssql database.
